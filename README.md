## Project Description

**Project Aims:**

This project aims to improve delivery logistics by implementing an efficient route planning system for drivers. Currently, the delivery fleet is underutilised due to fixed routes and inefficient assignment practices that do not consider package quantities, leading to unreliable delivery times. By developing a dynamic route planning system, this project aims to optimise delivery routes, ensuring efficient vehicle utilisation and timely deliveries. The project's goal is to revolutionise delivery operations within RainforestRetail, maximising fleet efficiency and delivering a superior customer experience.

**How to generate a GeoAPIFY key needed to this project:**

To use GeoAPIFY's mapping services with our project, you'll need to get a GeoAPIFY API key. Here's how to get one:

1. Sign up for a GeoAPIFY Account by visiting the following link: [GeoAPIFY](https://www.geoapify.com/) .
2. Click on ```"Sign Up"```. Fill out the registration form and create your free account.
3. Obtain your API key by following these instructions:
- Once logged in to your GeoAPIFY account, navigate to your profile settings.
- In your profile settings, you'll find your unique API key.

4. Storing your API key securely:
**- Important: Never share your API key publicly.** This is because it grants access to your GeoAPIFY account and should therefore be treated like a password.
- Store this API key securely within the project's environment variables - typically an ```.env``` file at the root of your project (outside the ```src``` directory.


## List of Example Routes:
-Full urls including placeholders for variables (localhost:8080/users/:id)
-Permitted requests for each route (GET, POST, etc)
-Examples of permitted requests where appropriate
-Examples of responses
-Routes should be organised by route and not by request method
